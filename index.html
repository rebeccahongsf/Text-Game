	<p id="area_bedroom">You wake up in a luxurious bed with a massive headache. You can't seem to recall where you are, how you got there, let alone who you are. Besides you lays a woman who appears to be unconscious. On the bedside table, there is a gun and wallet. A sleek jacket sits on the couch besides the main door, which is facing the east. As your eyes scan the room, there is a window to the north of you. In front of the window, there is a coffee table with what appears to be half eaten Chinese take out. There is also a door leading to the bathoom to the west. You feel the woman besides you begins to stir. You should probably get moving.</p>

	<p id="area_bathroom" style="display: none;">You have entered the bathroom. To the left there is a bathtub. On the right there is a sink and toilet. A tooth brush balances itself on the edge of the sink.
	</p>

	<p id="area_outsideroom" style="display: none;">You step outside of the room. The hallway floor feels cold and there's a slight breeze coming from the right side of the hall.</p>

	<p id="doorlock" style="display:none;">The door locks behind you. I guess you won't be going back into that room.</p>
